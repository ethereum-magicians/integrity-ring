# Integrity Ring of the Ethereum Magicians âœ¨

## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is meant for a decentralized community. We are not focused on institutions but individual teams. As a community initiative, we encourage other initiatives to work on the development of this protocols and prevention schemes that will be discussed collectively.

The current draft for the CoC is hosted on HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/KAVQHbnRR8SMsY_YIin9qA](https://hackmd.io/KAVQHbnRR8SMsY_YIin9qA). This will transition to a version controlled system on GitHub in the near future.

It is proposed that the Code of Conduct project generally follow the [EIP workflow](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#eip-work-flow) so that the community and potential adopters of the completed policy can participate in a transparent feedbackand finalization process.

## Community Development

Humans have been working to communicate and collaborate ever since humans were a thing. Blockchains and decentralized networks promise better human collaboration at scale. This section of the repo provides resources to help make the community safer, more diverse, and more collaborative. The goal is not to tell people what to do, but improve the experience of interacting with the Ethereum community for everyone.
