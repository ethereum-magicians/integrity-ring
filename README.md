# Integrity Ring of the Ethereum Magicians

## Code of Conduct Project

This Code of Conduct is meant for a decentralized community. We are not focused on institutions but individual teams. As a community initiative, we encourage other initiatives to work on the development of this protocols and prevention schemes that will be discussed collectively.

The current proposed CoC v1 is hosted on HackMD: [https://hackmd.io/KAVQHbnRR8SMsY_YIin9qA](https://hackmd.io/KAVQHbnRR8SMsY_YIin9qA).

It is proposed that the Code of Conduct project generally follow the [EIP workflow](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#eip-work-flow) so that the community and potential adopters of the completed policy can participate in a transparent feedbackand finalization process.
