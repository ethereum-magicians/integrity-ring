# Ethereum Community's Code of Conduct v1

## Statement of Intent

This CoC is meant for a decentralized community. We are not focused on institutions but individual teams. As a community initiative, we encourage other initiatives to work on the development of this protocols and prevention schemes that will be discussed collectively.

We encourage you to promote this Code and take action (especially if you are in a leadership position) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.

Power protects people's crimes. Decentralization works towards eliminating power. Therefore we should work the to eliminate the adverse side-effects of power. 

## Code of Conduct

We do not tolerate racism, sexism, and hate speech of any kind.

We categorically reject abuse and harassment of any nature. Any report of this nature will be taken with utmost consideration and priority. 

We reject discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.

We preserve the privacy and confidentiality of the people involved in situations that breach this Code of Conduct,.

We reject attacks that involve violations of privacy of others and their personal data in the community.

Sanctions for breaches of this Code of Conduct will be commensurate with the severity of the infraction.

By the nature of our decentralized space, the adoption of this code of conduct will be voluntary, and up to individual teams.

## Glossary

**Demeaning behavior**
is acting in a way that reduces another person's dignity, sense of self-worth or respect within the community.

**Discrimination**
is the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race, ethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual orientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile, political view, morals, employment, or union activity.


**Harassment**
is any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.

**Sexual harassment**
includes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks of a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.

**Unwelcomed behavior**
*Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are:*
* how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient?
* would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way?
* would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization's newsletter?
* could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group?
* could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing?
* would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?

*Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.*
