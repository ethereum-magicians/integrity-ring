# CoC Opt-In Members

This will be a rolling list of people and projects who have opted in to the CoC. 

<br>

When you opt into the CoC, you're essentially saying:

- I'll do my best to not do the negative things in the CoC
- I'll do my best to do the things recommended by the Community Development Resources

No one is perfect and there will be mistakes. 

- Some of those mistakes will be from people trying to write the CoC.
- Some of those mistakes will be from people trying to impliment the CoC.
- Some of those mistakes will be from people trying to use the CoC to help resolve conflicts.

That's ok. What's important is that we acknowledge our mistakes, learn from them, and make them better. It's a team effort, but it starts with you :)

It is important to keep in mind that the CoC will evolve over time. It would be good to have version numbers on this just like any code library does. X.Y.Z where Z is a minor change, and Y is a major change. The members list can then show who has opted into each version. This requires that whenever there is a major update, members have to review and opt in to that version of the CoC. It's not a passive thing. It requires action.
