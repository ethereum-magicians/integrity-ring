# CoC Opt-In Members

This will be a rolling list of people and projects who have opted in to the CoC. 

Also, it is important to keep in mind that the CoC will evolve over time. It would be good to have version numbers on this just like any code library does. X.Y.Z where Z is a minor change, and Y is a major change. The members list can then show who has opted into each version. This requires that whenever there is a major update, members have to review and opt in to that version of the CoC. It's not a passive thing. It requires action.
