# Preventative Measures (rough draft)

This is a place for best practices on avoiding conflict and increasing collaboration. Often times the room cause of drama and confusion is simply miscommunication. Miscommunication leads to frustration. Frustration leads to drama. Drama leads to conflict and confusion. 

When people are conflicted and confused, we try to resolve our problems. Often times this is when it's too late. It's exponentially harder to empathize and think rationally when you're upset. It's also too late to undo the emotional pain and wasted energy that's resulted from the conflict.

With that in mind, "being nice" or "thinking empathetically" are strategies that only work in ideal conditions. When things get difficult they break down. We need strategies that are strong in adversarial conditions. One such strategy is thinking about incentives and playing to win positive sum games. This is much easier than trying to guess someone else's feelings. It also does not require altruism. It's a simple game where players try to get what, but knowing that they can only do so if the other players get what they want too. This doc explores some strategies, questions, and best practices to engage in such a way.

### Questions To Ask

Am I playing a positive sum game?
- Do I feel like it’s a game of “us/me vs them?” If so, are there any ideas or solutions that would be a win/win?
- Am I taking into consideration the interests of all parties involved, or just my own?

Am I talking about the person, or their ideas/actions?
- It’s always a good idea to be easy on people, but hard on ideas.
- Am I taking someone’s criticism of my ideas as an attack on me as a person? If so, try re-reading/thinking about it, but imagining it’s someone else’s idea. Does it look different from that perspective?

Am I creating value?
- If I am highlighting a problem, am I also proposing a solution? If so, is that solution supported by facts as well as feedback from the community? If not, am I seeking out feedback to create a win/win scenario or trying to sell people on my idea vs theirs?
- If I am highlighting a problem, what would have to change for that to no longer be a problem. What needs to happen to make it better? Sharing this feedback with other party could help facilitate constructive conversations rather than being stuck in the land of opinions and emotions.
- If I am proposing a solution, is it a solution for me or for all parties involved? If all parties involved would not be happy with this idea, is there a way to change it where they would be?

Are we talking about facts, or opinions?
- Can I back my idea up with facts? If so, what are those? Share them. If not, why? More research would make for a more persuasive discussion.
- Can I argue for the other side of this issue as well, or do I only understand my own viewpoint?
