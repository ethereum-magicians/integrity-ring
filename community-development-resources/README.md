This is a place for best practices on avoiding conflict and increasing collaboration. Often times the room cause of drama and confusion is simply miscommunication. Miscommunication leads to frustration. Frustration leads to drama. Drama leads to conflict and confusion. 

When people are conflicted and confused, we try to resolve our problems. Often times this is when it's too late. It's exponentially harder to empathize and think rationally when you're upset. It's also too late to undo the emotional pain and wasted energy that's resulted from the conflict.

With that in mind, "being nice" or "thinking empathetically" are strategies that only work in ideal conditions. When things get difficult they break down. We need strategies that are strong in adversarial conditions. One such strategy is thinking about incentives and playing to win positive sum games. This is much easier than trying to guess someone else's feelings. It also does not require altruism. It's a simple game where players try to get what, but knowing that they can only do so if the other players get what they want too. This repo explores some strategies, questions, and best practices to engage in such a way.
