# Questions To Ask

Questions to reframe problems in a positive sum context. The goal of these questions is not to make you compromise on your position. The goal is to give you a broader perspective. This will help you present arguements more persuasively by framing them in the context of how your idea benefits the people you're talking to. 

### Am I playing a positive sum game?
- Do I feel like it’s a game of “us/me vs them?” If so, are there any ideas or solutions that would be a win/win?
- Am I taking into consideration the interests of all parties involved, or just my own?

### Am I talking about the person, or their ideas/actions?
- It’s always a good idea to be easy on people, but hard on ideas.
- Am I taking someone’s criticism of my ideas as an attack on me as a person? If so, try re-reading/thinking about it, but imagining it’s someone else’s idea. Does it look different from that perspective?

### Am I creating value?
- If I am highlighting a problem, am I also proposing a solution? If so, is that solution supported by facts as well as feedback from the community? If not, am I seeking out feedback to create a win/win scenario or trying to sell people on my idea vs theirs?
- If I am highlighting a problem, what would have to change for that to no longer be a problem. What needs to happen to make it better? Sharing this feedback with other party could help facilitate constructive conversations rather than being stuck in the land of opinions and emotions.
- If I am proposing a solution, is it a solution for me or for all parties involved? If all parties involved would not be happy with this idea, is there a way to change it where they would be?

### Are we talking about facts, or opinions?
- Can I back my idea up with facts? If so, what are those? Share them. If not, why? More research would make for a more persuasive discussion.
- Can I argue for the other side of this issue as well, or do I only understand my own viewpoint?

### TBD
- If you think of a question that should be added to this list, please submit a PR or open an issue! :)
