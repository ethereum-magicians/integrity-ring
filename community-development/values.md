# Values

This is for general guiding principles that the Ethereum community thinks are important.

### Decentralization: no one party has the power

### Permission-less Innovation: anyone can participate

### Censorship Resistant: no one can stop anyone else from participating

### TBD: you decide! Create an issue or PR with ideas :)
