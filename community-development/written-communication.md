# Written Communication

Communication is hard. Communication with a decentralized asynchronous community is even harder. If you don't speak the langauge it's nearly impossible.

Often times, disagreements occur because we don't feel heard. We care about something deeply, we share our beliefs, and then feel frustrated when people don't understand. It's not just you that's frustrated though. Everyone else is having the same experience. This means the more people are communicating their ideas, the more likely they are to be misinterpreted. The more misinterpreted our ideas are, the more frustrated we get. The more frustrated we get the more we try to make people understand. This results in anger, burnout, and sadness.  

It doesn't have to be that way! While communication is hard, there are tons of people who have been building tools and sharing ideas that can make it better. This is a place to aggregate those tools and resources to help everyone have better written communication :)
