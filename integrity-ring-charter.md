# Integrity Ring Charter

### Ring Name
- Integrity Ring (why?)

### Ring Description
- Communication is hard. Communication across a globally decentralized community that is communicating asynchronously via digital forums is even harder. We are working to improve this. Our goal is to make the Ethereum community safer and more collaborative. We are doing this via an opt-in Community Code of Conduct and an open repo of resources to improve communication. Anyone is free to adopt or contribute to the C-CoC. All the communication tools and resources are free and available online. Anyone can contribute to either at any time :)
